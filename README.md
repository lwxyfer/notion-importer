## Build

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

The built plugin will be in the `dist/` directory and packaged as `package.zip`.

## Architecture

- `export-parser`: ZIP walk, `index.html` manifest parsing, registry building
- `notion-normalizer`: canonical write plan for SiYuan
- `siyuan-writer`: notebook/doc/asset/database writes and post-processing

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite in watch mode, outputting to the `dev/` directory with live reload.
